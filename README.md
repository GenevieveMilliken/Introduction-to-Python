Welcome to Introduction to Python | NYU Health Sciences Library

Instructor: Genevieve Milliken, MA, MSLIS
            Data Services Librarian, NYU Health Sciences Library, NYU Langone Health
            
This beginner-level class will address concepts foundational to all programming languages and provide an introduction to coding more generally using Python as its framework for learning. The class will begin with a brief discussion about why Python is useful and how it can be implemented into your workflow. Weâ€™ll spend the remainder of the class using Python to learn about programming basics and best practices.

By the end of class, learners will be exposed to:

- Basic Syntax
- Data Types
- Variables
- Functions
- Arguments
- Logical operations and conditional statements
- For Loops
- Python Libraries

Learners are not expected to have significant previous coding experience prior to attending. We will be using Jupyter Notebook and the open-source Anaconda Distribution. Please install Anaconda (which comes with Jupyter Notebook) prior to the workshop: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
