    "Python is an incredibly efficient programming language and allows us to do some impressive things with only a few lines of code! Thanks to Python’s syntax, we can write “clean” code that is easier to debug and allows for overall readability. Further, code written in Python is easily extendable and reusable, allowing you and others to build upon existing code. Python is used in a variety of contexts from game design to data analysis. It is also used a lot in academic research, especially in the sciences. Yet, it has utility regardless what discipline you come from or are currently working in.\n"

    "If Python is installed on your computer, you can interact with it on the command line, sometimes referred to as the \"terminal\", \"console\", \"Python shell\" or \"REPL\" (Read, Eval, Print and Loop). More often, people use a text editor, such as [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or more sophisticated IDEs such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to write and run code. With a lot of setups available, you have many options to choose from!\n",

    "Today, we are using a browser-based Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda, which allows users to selectively run code cells and add rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, notes, links) in Markdown. With code, notes, instructions, and comments all in one place, it serves as a powerful resource and learning tool for you!"
