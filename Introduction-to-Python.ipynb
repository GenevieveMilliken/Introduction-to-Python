    "# Why Python?\n",
    "Python is an incredibly efficient programming language and allows you to do some impressive things with only a few lines of code! Thanks to Python’s syntax, we can write “clean” code that is easier to debug and allows for overall readability. Further, code written in Python is easily extendable and reusable, allowing you and others to build upon existing code. Python is used in a variety of contexts from game design to data analysis. It is also used a lot in academic research, especially in the sciences, and can be used for data collection (e.g., web scraping), data cleaning, data analysis, and visualization.\n"

    "\n",
    "Since it is relatively easy to use compared to other programming languages, Python has been widely adopted by researchers who don't want to spend a whole lot of time learning computer programming before they can start their actual project. Additionally, over the years an entire ecosystem of helper libraries (or \"packages\") has been developed to make scientific tasks even easier in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may have already heard of some of these libraries, such as [PANDAS](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (which contains functions for data analysis), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) (science and engineering), [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/) (multi-dimensional data structures and high-level mathematics), [BioPython](https://biopython.org/) (biological computing), etc. There is some overlap between these libraries, and typically you will combine features from several different libraries to accomplish your research tasks.\n"

    "If Python is installed on your computer, you can interact with it on the command line, sometimes referred to as the \"terminal\", \"console\", \"Python shell\" or \"REPL\" (Read, Eval, Print and Loop). More often, people use a text editor, such as [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or more sophisticated IDEs such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to write and run code. With a lot of setups available, you have many options to choose from!\n",

With code, notes, instructions, and comments all in one place, it serves as a powerful resource and learning tool for you!\n",

    "Programming is a huge topic, and you can spend an entire lifetime learning and improving. So it's impossible for me to teach you everything you need to know in this one class. Therefore, I don't want you to get too bogged down in the details. It's OK if you leave this class without knowing the proper command for reversing a Python list. You may never have to use that command, and if you ever do, there is no shame in Googling it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's much more important that you leave this class knowing how and where to find help when you need it. In fact, learning to search the internet for help is a very important part of programming. No matter what you're trying to do with Python, someone else has already done it before, and has probably posted about it online to help others. You just need to Google the right words to find it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the best way to learn Python is to find a problem that interests you, and that you need Python to solve. Once you are working towards a specific goal like this, the problems you face will become much smaller, and you'll know what questions you need to ask to accomplish your goal. For example, instead of your task being \"Learn Python\" (which can take an entire lifetime) your task will be, \"how to get standard deviation of all numbers in a list in Python.\" That is much easier!"

But after looking around the internet, I quickly found that doing any kind of a loop over a Pandas DataFrame is not recommended. Instead, we can use the [`apply()` function](http://jonathansoma.com/lede/foundations/classes/pandas%20columns%20and%20functions/apply-a-function-to-every-row-in-a-pandas-dataframe/).\n",

    "First we will define a simple function that returns the percentage, and then we pass that function as a parameter into the `apply()` function. Our second parameter to `apply()` is `axis=1` which tells Pandas we want this to be applied on a row-by-row basis (the default is `axis=0` or column-by-column). I've never used `apply()` before, so let's just run it real quick to make sure it works right:"
